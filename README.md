# Project
I'm currently working on a cibersec project and I must develop a pipeline to analyze the content of emails.

# Model
With google-bert/bert-base-uncased I was able to feed the model an email dataset so as it can identify phishing techniques on emails.

# Other tools
There is a tool to detect strange characters such as invisible or homographs.
There is another tool to detect common phishing words.

# Team
My team is working on developing another tools to verify the emails' authors and attachments.
